    <h1>We Help Freelancers Keep More of What They Earn</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">FreelanceCompare is a free, independent tool that shows you the real cost of freelancing on every major platform — including the fees they don't advertise.</p>

    <div class="section-label">Our Story</div>
    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>

    <div class="prose">
      <p>When I landed my first freelance project — a $500 website redesign on one of the big platforms — I was thrilled. Then I got paid. After the platform took its cut, the payment processor took its cut, and I factored in what I'd spent just to win the project, I was staring at barely $400. Nobody told me about any of that when I signed up.</p>

      <p>I started doing the math across different platforms and quickly realized the fee structures are confusing on purpose. Some charge you 20% right off the top. Others look cheaper until you factor in the connects you burn through, the small order surcharges, or the withdrawal fees that slowly bleed your earnings. A $500 project can mean wildly different things depending on where you work.</p>

      <p>I looked for a tool that would just lay it all out — every platform, every fee, side by side. It didn't exist. So I built one.</p>

      <p>FreelanceCompare isn't backed by any platform or agency. It's a straightforward calculator built by a freelancer who got tired of doing this math on the back of a napkin. If it saves you even one bad decision about where to list your next project, it's done its job.</p>

    <h2>How Our Calculator Works</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">Three principles guide everything we build: accuracy, transparency, and simplicity.</p>

        <h3>Real Fee Data</h3>
        <p>We research each platform's current fee structure directly from their official documentation. Our data includes service fees, withdrawal costs, and hidden charges like Connects and small order fees.</p>

    <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">Here's exactly how we calculate the numbers you see in our tool.</p>

    <ol class="method-list">
      <li>We calculate freelancer-side fees — the amount that gets deducted directly from your earnings on each platform.</li>
      <li>Client-side fees (marketplace fees, service charges) are shown separately for transparency, so you understand the full picture without distorting your take-home number.</li>
      <li>Hidden costs like Upwork Connects, Fiverr small order fees, and withdrawal fees are displayed but not deducted from the main take-home figure, since they vary per user and per transaction.</li>
      <li>All fee data is sourced from official platform documentation and pricing pages. We link to sources where possible and re-verify data regularly.</li>
      <li>For GBP-based platforms like PeoplePerHour, we use approximate USD equivalents and clearly note this in the results. Exchange rates fluctuate, so treat these as estimates.</li>
      <li>We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or partnered with any of the platforms listed in our calculator. Our rankings are determined purely by math.</li>
    </ol>
