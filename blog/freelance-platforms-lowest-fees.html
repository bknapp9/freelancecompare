Toptal charges nothing to freelancers but earns its margin from the client rate. These zero-fee platforms typically have smaller or more specialized client pools compared to Upwork or Fiverr."

        "text": "Often yes, especially early in your career. Upwork's large client base (796K+ active clients) can outweigh a 10% fee if you're winning more projects. A smaller platform with 0% fees doesn't help if there are no clients to hire you. As you build a client base, diversifying to lower-fee platforms for repeat work becomes increasingly worthwhile."

Most platform terms allow multi-platform use as long as you don't actively solicit clients you met on their platform to move off-platform."

      <h2>Why Platform Fees Matter More Than You Think</h2>
      <p>At $50,000 in annual freelance earnings, a 20% platform fee costs you <span class="fee-cost">$10,000 per year</span>. A 10% fee costs $5,000. A 0% fee costs nothing. That's not a rounding error &mdash; it's the difference between a financially comfortable freelance career and one where a significant portion of your labor funds someone else's platform.</p>
      <p>Yet most freelancers pick platforms based on brand recognition, not fee structure. This guide ranks every major freelance platform from lowest to highest fees, with real cost tables and honest assessments of where each platform is worth the price.</p>

      <h2>#1 Contra &mdash; 0% Freelancer Fee</h2>
      <p>Contra is the clearest answer to "which freelance platform has the lowest fees" &mdash; it charges freelancers absolutely nothing. Zero percent commission, no matter what you earn.</p>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Contra charges clients a subscription fee rather than per-project commissions. Freelancers keep 100% of their negotiated rate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freelancer fee:</strong> 0%</li>
        <li><strong>Client fee:</strong> Subscription-based (clients pay Contra directly)</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Designers, developers, marketers, and creative professionals</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum payout:</strong> $1 via Stripe</li>
        <li><strong>Payments:</strong> Near-instant via Stripe; also supports ACH and wire</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Zero commission, professional profile pages, project management tools built in</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Smaller client pool than Upwork or Fiverr; less brand recognition; more competitive vetting to get approved</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you can build a presence on Contra and attract clients, you'll keep far more of every dollar you earn than on any other mainstream platform. The trade-off is that you'll need to drive your own client discovery or supplement with other platforms.</p>

      <h2>#2 Hubstaff Talent &mdash; 0% Freelancer Fee</h2>
      <p>Hubstaff Talent is a free marketplace built by Hubstaff, the time-tracking software company. Neither freelancers nor clients pay any commission.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freelancer fee:</strong> 0%</li>
        <li><strong>Client fee:</strong> 0%</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Remote workers who want direct client relationships, developers, virtual assistants</li>
        <li><strong>How Hubstaff makes money:</strong> By converting clients into Hubstaff time-tracking software subscribers</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Completely free to use, integrates with Hubstaff time tracking, direct client payments</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Significantly smaller client base than major platforms; less built-in payment protection; requires more self-management</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Best as a supplementary platform or for freelancers who already have a strong network and want a free way to list their services. Not ideal as your primary source of new clients.</p>

      <h2>#3 Toptal &mdash; 0% to Freelancers (Elite Tier)</h2>
      <p>Toptal markets itself as the "top 3%" of freelance talent. It charges freelancers nothing &mdash; but this doesn't mean it's cheap. Toptal earns its revenue by charging clients a significant premium above your negotiated rate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freelancer fee:</strong> 0% directly</li>
        <li><strong>How Toptal earns:</strong> Clients pay Toptal, Toptal pays you a pre-agreed rate &mdash; the margin stays with the platform</li>
        <li><strong>Typical rates:</strong> Senior developers earn $80&ndash;$200+/hour; Toptal charges clients $150&ndash;$350+/hour for the same work</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptance rate:</strong> Approximately 3% of applicants pass the vetting process</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Elite developers, designers, and finance professionals with verifiable senior-level skills</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Premium clients, high rates, no bidding, dedicated matching team</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Very selective admission; opaque margin structure; less flexibility to set your own rates</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you can pass Toptal's screening, you'll earn well without platform commissions. But the hidden margin in the client rate means the platform's cut is built in &mdash; you just don't see it itemized.</p>

      <h2>#4 Guru &mdash; 5&ndash;9% Depending on Membership</h2>
      <p>Guru offers the lowest visible fees among large-scale marketplaces with significant client pools. Its tiered membership model lets active freelancers reduce their fee to as low as 5%.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic (free):</strong> 9% handling fee</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Plus (~$9/mo):</strong> 7% handling fee</li>
        <li><strong>Professional (~$30/mo):</strong> 5% handling fee</li>
        <li><strong>Client fee:</strong> 2.9% + $0.30 per payment</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Developers, designers, content writers looking for long-term projects</li>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> SafePay escrow system; funds released after work acceptance</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Low fees for active freelancers, good for project-based work, flexible payment structure</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Smaller platform than Upwork; fewer clients posting in some niches; membership fee partially offsets the lower commission</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> At 5&ndash;9%, Guru is the best mainstream option for fee-conscious freelancers who want a real client marketplace. The Professional plan at ~$30/month pays for itself quickly if you're winning regular work.</p>

      <h2>#5 Upwork &mdash; 0&ndash;15% (Average ~10%)</h2>
      <p>Upwork is the world's largest freelance marketplace and charges a variable rate between 0% and 15%, with most freelancers landing around 10%. For a full breakdown, see our <a href="/blog/upwork-fees-explained">complete Upwork fee guide</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freelancer fee:</strong> 0&ndash;15% variable (algorithm-determined)</li>
        <li><strong>Client fee:</strong> Up to 7.99% marketplace fee</li>
        <li><strong>Connects cost:</strong> $0.15 each; most proposals require 4&ndash;16 Connects</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Freelancers building a client base; long-term contracts; high-value professional services</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Massive client base (796K+ active clients), strong payment protection, hourly tracking tools</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Connects add hidden bidding costs; fee rate is opaque (varies by contract); competitive for new freelancers</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Despite not having the lowest fees, Upwork's sheer scale makes it one of the most effective platforms for finding new clients. The 10% fee is justified for most freelancers by the volume of available work.</p>

      <h2>#6 Freelancer.com &mdash; 10% or $5 Minimum</h2>
      <p>Freelancer.com charges a flat 10% fee (or $5 minimum, whichever is greater) on every project. For a detailed breakdown including bid costs and membership tiers, see our <a href="/blog/freelancer-com-fees-explained">Freelancer.com fee guide</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freelancer fee:</strong> 10% or $5 minimum</li>
        <li><strong>Client fee:</strong> 3% or $3 minimum</li>
        <li><strong>Preferred Freelancer:</strong> 3% fee on employer-invited projects (invite-only)</li>
        <li><strong>Free bids:</strong> 8/month on free tier</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Short-term project work, contest-style jobs, beginners building a portfolio</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Large global marketplace, contest marketplace, milestone payment protection</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> $5 minimum hurts small projects; competitive bidding environment; older UI</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Comparable in cost to Upwork for most projects, but the $5 minimum makes Freelancer.com expensive for low-value work. Better suited to project sizes of $100+.</p>

      <h2>#7 PeoplePerHour &mdash; 3.5&ndash;20% Tiered</h2>
      <p>PeoplePerHour uses a tiered system similar to Upwork's old model &mdash; the more you earn with a single client, the lower your fee rate. New clients start at the highest tier.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First $700 per client:</strong> 20% fee</li>
        <li><strong>$701&ndash;$7,000 per client:</strong> 7.5% fee</li>
        <li><strong>Above $7,000 per client:</strong> 3.5% fee</li>
        <li><strong>Client fee:</strong> ~3%</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> UK/European freelancers; content creators; web developers</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong in UK/European markets, fee decreases with client loyalty, project-based and hourly options</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> 20% on initial client earnings is steep; smaller global reach than Upwork; slower payment release</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> PeoplePerHour is expensive for new client relationships but becomes competitive (3.5%) on large or repeat contracts. Best suited to freelancers targeting European clients who build long-term relationships.</p>

      <h2>#8 Fiverr &mdash; 20% Flat (All Earnings)</h2>
      <p>Fiverr charges the highest flat commission rate of any major platform &mdash; a non-negotiable 20% on every order, including tips. For the complete breakdown, see our <a href="/blog/fiverr-fees-explained">Fiverr seller fee guide</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freelancer fee:</strong> 20% flat on all earnings, no tiers, no exceptions</li>
        <li><strong>Client fee:</strong> 5.5% + $3 small order fee (on orders under $100)</li>
        <li><strong>Effective combined take:</strong> 24&ndash;35% depending on order size</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> High-volume, standardized service delivery; creative freelancers with rankable gigs</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Massive buyer traffic (80M+ visitors/month), inbound leads, no bidding required</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Highest fee rate of any major platform; 14-day payment hold (standard); buyer-side fees reduce pricing power</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Fiverr's 20% is steep, but for freelancers who build well-ranked gigs, the passive inbound client flow can justify the higher cost. Compare it to spending time bidding on Upwork or Freelancer.com &mdash; time has value too.</p>

      <h2>Hidden Fees to Watch Out For</h2>
      <p>The commission percentage is only part of the story. These hidden fees catch many freelancers off guard:</p>

      <h3>Bid and Connect Costs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Upwork Connects:</strong> $0.15 each; proposals cost 4&ndash;16 Connects ($0.60&ndash;$2.40 each)</li>
        <li><strong>Freelancer.com extra bids:</strong> $0.75 per bid beyond free monthly allocation</li>
        <li><strong>Active bidders</strong> can spend $25&ndash;$100/month before winning a single project</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Withdrawal and Transfer Fees</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wire transfers:</strong> $2 (Upwork), $25+ (Freelancer.com bank wire), varies by platform</li>
        <li><strong>Currency conversion:</strong> 2&ndash;4% on non-USD payouts &mdash; paid to the payment processor, not the platform</li>
        <li><strong>PayPal currency conversion:</strong> Typically 3&ndash;4% if you receive USD and convert to another currency</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Membership and Subscription Fees</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Upwork Freelancer Plus:</strong> $14.99/month (more Connects, better visibility)</li>
        <li><strong>Freelancer.com Plus:</strong> $35/month (100 bids/month)</li>
        <li><strong>Guru Professional:</strong> ~$30/month (5% handling fee vs 9% on free tier)</li>
        <li>These can add $100&ndash;$500/year to your real platform costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment Holds and Timing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fiverr:</strong> 14-day hold (standard), 7-day (Top Rated/Pro)</li>
        <li><strong>Upwork:</strong> 5 days (fixed-price), 10 days (hourly)</li>
        <li>Money tied up in holds has an opportunity cost &mdash; especially if you're managing cash flow</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Annual Cost at $25K and $50K Earnings</h2>
      <p>Here's the real-world impact of each platform's fee structure, assuming consistent earnings at each level. Figures include estimated bid/connect costs where applicable.</p>

        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The difference between using Contra (0%) and Fiverr (20%) at $50K annual earnings is <span class="fee-cost">$10,000 per year</span>. Over a 5-year freelance career, that's $50,000 kept or given away &mdash; purely based on platform choice.</p>

      <h2>Which Platform Is Right for You?</h2>
      <p>The lowest fee platform isn't always the best platform. Here's how to think about the trade-off:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Just starting out?</strong> Use Upwork or Fiverr first. Their client bases are the most likely to generate your first projects, even with higher fees. Once you've built reviews and a client base, diversify.</li>
        <li><strong>Established freelancer?</strong> Add Contra or Guru to keep more of your earnings on projects that don't require heavy discovery. Route repeat clients there when appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Elite specialist?</strong> Apply to Toptal. If you pass, you'll earn premium rates with zero commission and a dedicated matching team handling client acquisition for you.</li>
        <li><strong>UK/European focus?</strong> PeoplePerHour becomes competitive on repeat clients. The 3.5% tier on $7,000+ per client makes it one of the lowest-fee options for established relationships in that market.</li>
        <li><strong>Gig-based services?</strong> Fiverr's 20% is expensive, but the inbound traffic is unique. A well-ranked gig generates leads without any active bidding &mdash; which has real time value.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Which freelance platform has the lowest fees?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Contra and Hubstaff Talent both charge 0% to freelancers. Toptal also takes 0% directly from freelancers. Among mainstream platforms with large client pools, Guru offers the lowest fees at 5&ndash;9%, followed by Upwork at 0&ndash;15% (averaging ~10%) and Freelancer.com at 10%.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Are there freelance platforms with no fees at all?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Contra charges freelancers 0% &mdash; clients pay a small subscription instead. Hubstaff Talent has no fees for either side. Toptal charges nothing to freelancers but earns its margin from the client rate. These zero-fee platforms typically have smaller or more specialized client pools compared to Upwork or Fiverr.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Is it worth paying higher fees for bigger platforms like Upwork?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Often yes, especially early in your career. Upwork's large client base (796K+ active clients) can outweigh a 10% fee if you're winning more projects than you would elsewhere. A smaller platform with 0% fees doesn't help if there are no clients to hire you. As you build a client base, diversifying to lower-fee platforms for repeat work becomes increasingly worthwhile.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How do I calculate my real take-home pay after platform fees?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Take your project rate, subtract the platform fee percentage, then subtract any applicable bid or connect costs and withdrawal fees. Our free calculator on FreelanceCompare handles all of this automatically &mdash; enter your rate and platform to see your real take-home pay instantly.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Can I use multiple freelance platforms at the same time?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, and many experienced freelancers do exactly this. You might use Upwork or Fiverr for discovery, then maintain long-term client relationships on lower-fee platforms. Most platform terms allow multi-platform use as long as you don't actively solicit clients you originally found on their platform to move off-platform.</p>
