      <h2>Upwork's Fee Structure at a Glance</h2>
      <p>Upwork overhauled its fee structure in May 2025. The old tiered system &mdash; where you paid 20% on your first $500, 10% up to $10K, and 5% above $10K with the same client &mdash; is gone. Now freelancers pay a variable commission between <span class="fee-cost">0% and 15%</span>, with most freelancers effectively paying around 10%.</p>
      <p>The simplification is welcome, but the new system trades transparency for simplicity. You don't know your exact fee rate until you see it on a contract &mdash; it varies based on supply and demand, project type, and other factors Upwork doesn't fully disclose.</p>

      <h2>Freelancer Service Fee (0&ndash;15%)</h2>
      <p>Here's what you need to know about Upwork's new fee model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variable rate</strong> between 0% and 15%, determined by Upwork's algorithm</li>
        <li><strong>Most freelancers report paying approximately 10%</strong> on the majority of contracts</li>
        <li><strong>Previous structure (before May 2025):</strong> 20% on first $500, 10% up to $10K, 5% above $10K with the same client</li>
        <li><strong>The new system is less transparent</strong> &mdash; you don't know your exact rate until you see it on each contract</li>
        <li><strong>Contract initiation fee:</strong> $0.99 to $14.99 per new client contract</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The variable rate means two freelancers doing similar work could pay different fees. Upwork says the rate considers "multiple factors" but doesn't publish the formula. In practice, most freelancers see rates clustering around 10%.</p>

      <h2>The Connects System &mdash; Upwork's Hidden Cost</h2>
      <p>This is the fee most new freelancers don't see coming. Before you even win a project, you're spending money just to apply.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freelancers need "Connects" to submit proposals</strong> to job postings</li>
        <li><strong>Free allocation:</strong> 10 Connects per month</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Connects:</strong> $0.15 each</li>
        <li><strong>Most job proposals cost 4&ndash;16 Connects</strong> ($0.60&ndash;$2.40 per proposal)</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized or boosted proposals</strong> can cost significantly more</li>
        <li><strong>At 10 proposals per week</strong>, you could spend $25&ndash;$100/month just applying</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This cost exists regardless of whether you win the project. If you submit 10 proposals and land one client, you've spent Connects on all 10. Upwork does refund Connects for withdrawn job posts, but not for jobs you simply didn't get.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Connects are the cost of doing business on Upwork. Budget for them like a marketing expense &mdash; they're real money spent before you earn a dollar.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Client Fees</h2>
      <p>Upwork doesn't just charge freelancers. Clients pay their own set of fees, which affects your pricing power:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Marketplace fee:</strong> up to 7.99% on payments to freelancers</li>
        <li><strong>Contract initiation fee:</strong> varies by contract type</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise plans:</strong> custom pricing starting at $849/month</li>
        <li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> 3% + $3 per payment via ACH</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Withdrawal Fees</h2>
      <p>Once your earnings clear Upwork's holding period, here's what it costs to get paid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct deposit (US):</strong> Free</li>
        <li><strong>ACH:</strong> Free</li>
        <li><strong>Wire transfer:</strong> $2</li>
        <li><strong>PayPal:</strong> Varies (PayPal's own fees apply)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Payment timeline:</strong> Hourly contracts pay 10 days after the billing period ends. Fixed-price contracts release funds 5 days after client approval. This is faster than Fiverr's 14-day standard hold, but you still need to plan for the gap.</p>

      <h2>Real Cost Examples</h2>
      <p>Here's what Upwork actually costs when you factor in the service fee and Connects. We're assuming 10% service fee and ~6 Connects per proposal ($0.90):</p>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Project</th>
              <th>Freelancer Fee (10%)</th>
              <th>Connects (~6)</th>
              <th>Take-Home</th>
              <th>Effective Loss</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>$100</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">$10</span></td>
              <td>~$0.90</td>
              <td>$89.10</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">10.9%</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$500</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">$50</span></td>
              <td>~$0.90</td>
              <td>$449.10</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">10.2%</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$1,000</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">$100</span></td>
              <td>~$0.90</td>
              <td>$899.10</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">10.1%</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$5,000</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">$500</span></td>
              <td>~$0.90</td>
              <td>$4,499.10</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">10.0%</span></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Connects cost is per proposal, not per win. If you submit 5 proposals before winning a job, multiply the Connects cost by 5. A $500 project that took 5 proposals really cost you $50 in fees + $4.50 in Connects = $54.50 total.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Tips to Maximize Earnings on Upwork</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be selective</strong> &mdash; only apply to jobs with fewer than 5 proposals and posted recently. Your Connects go further when competition is low.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider Freelancer Plus ($14.99/month)</strong> if you're applying heavily &mdash; it gives you more Connects and better visibility in search results</li>
        <li><strong>Build long-term client relationships</strong> &mdash; repeat clients mean fewer Connects spent on proposals and more predictable income</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize your profile</strong> for Upwork's search algorithm &mdash; a strong title, relevant skills, and a complete portfolio increase your visibility</li>
        <li><strong>Aim for the Top Rated badge</strong> &mdash; it unlocks better visibility, a confidential earnings badge, and faster payment release</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Upwork Compares to Other Platforms</h2>
      <p>Upwork's ~10% fee lands in the middle of the pack. It's significantly better than Fiverr's flat 20%, roughly comparable to Freelancer.com's 10%, and higher than Guru's 5&ndash;9%. Zero-fee platforms like Contra let freelancers keep everything, but have smaller client pools.</p>
      <p>The Connects system is unique to Upwork and adds a cost layer that other platforms don't have. Factor this in when comparing &mdash; a 10% fee with $50/month in Connects isn't the same as a clean 10%.</p>
