      <h2>The Quick Answer</h2>
      <p>On a $500 project: Upwork takes ~<span class="fee-cost">$50</span> (10%), Fiverr takes ~<span class="fee-cost">$100</span> (20%). That's a $50 difference on a single project. Over a year earning $5,000/month, that gap becomes <span class="fee-cost">$6,000</span> in extra fees on Fiverr.</p>
      <p>But fees aren't the whole story. The two platforms work fundamentally differently, attract different types of clients, and suit different freelancing styles. Let's break it all down.</p>

      <h2>Fee Structure Comparison</h2>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Feature</th>
              <th>Upwork</th>
              <th>Fiverr</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Freelancer Fee</strong></td>
              <td>~10% (variable 0&ndash;15%)</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">20% flat</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Client Fee</strong></td>
              <td>Up to 7.99%</td>
              <td>5.5% + small order fee</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Tips Fee</strong></td>
              <td>Same rate (~10%)</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">20% (yes, on tips too)</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Proposal Cost</strong></td>
              <td>4&ndash;16 Connects ($0.60&ndash;$2.40)</td>
              <td>Free (no bidding)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Withdrawal</strong></td>
              <td>Free (direct deposit)</td>
              <td>$1&ndash;$3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Payment Speed</strong></td>
              <td>5&ndash;10 days</td>
              <td>7&ndash;14 days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Combined Take Rate</strong></td>
              <td>~18.5%</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">~32.3%</span></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Combined take rate</strong> includes both buyer and seller fees. This represents the total "tax" the platform charges on each transaction. Upwork keeps about 18.5 cents of every dollar that flows through the platform. Fiverr keeps about 32.3 cents.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>How Each Platform Works</h2>
      <p>The fundamental difference between Upwork and Fiverr goes beyond fees &mdash; they're built on completely different models.</p>

      <h3>Upwork: Proposal-Based</h3>
      <p>On Upwork, clients post job listings and freelancers apply. You browse jobs, write proposals explaining why you're the right fit, and compete with other freelancers for the project. The client reviews proposals and picks their freelancer. This means you're actively hunting for work &mdash; every project requires effort to win.</p>

      <h3>Fiverr: Storefront-Based</h3>
      <p>On Fiverr, you create "gigs" &mdash; service listings with fixed descriptions, pricing tiers, and delivery timelines. Buyers search for what they need, browse gig listings, and place orders directly. Once your gigs rank well in search, buyers come to you. It's more passive, but getting those initial rankings takes time and effort.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>At $5,000/month in gross earnings, the fee difference between Upwork and Fiverr is <strong>$6,000 per year</strong>. That's a significant amount &mdash; enough for a vacation, a new laptop, or a few months of savings.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Upwork Pros and Cons</h2>
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower fees</strong> &mdash; ~10% vs Fiverr's 20% means significantly more in your pocket</li>
        <li><strong>Bigger client budgets</strong> &mdash; average spend per client is $5,045/year vs $309/year on Fiverr</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term contracts</strong> &mdash; hourly contracts with ongoing work are common</li>
        <li><strong>Hourly tracking</strong> &mdash; built-in time tracker with screenshots protects your billing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Connects cost money</strong> &mdash; $25&ndash;$100/month just to apply for work</li>
        <li><strong>Harder to get started</strong> &mdash; new freelancers compete against established profiles</li>
        <li><strong>Active effort required</strong> &mdash; you need to write proposals for every job</li>
        <li><strong>Profile approval</strong> &mdash; Upwork may not accept your application in all categories</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fiverr Pros and Cons</h2>
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Passive income model</strong> &mdash; once gigs rank, buyers come to you</li>
        <li><strong>Easier to start</strong> &mdash; create a gig and you're live, no approval process</li>
        <li><strong>No bidding system</strong> &mdash; no Connects to buy, no proposals to write</li>
        <li><strong>Massive buyer traffic</strong> &mdash; 80M+ monthly visitors browsing for services</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>20% fee is steep</strong> &mdash; double what most other platforms charge</li>
        <li><strong>Race to the bottom</strong> &mdash; buyers often filter by lowest price</li>
        <li><strong>14-day payment hold</strong> &mdash; your money is locked for 2 weeks after delivery</li>
        <li><strong>Small order fees</strong> &mdash; the $3 buyer surcharge under $100 discourages small purchases</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Use Upwork</h2>
      <p>Upwork is the better choice when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You want <strong>long-term client relationships</strong> with recurring work</li>
        <li>Your projects are <strong>$500+</strong> where the 10% fee advantage really adds up</li>
        <li>You work in <strong>tech, consulting, or professional services</strong> where clients have bigger budgets</li>
        <li>You <strong>don't mind writing proposals</strong> and actively pursuing work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Use Fiverr</h2>
      <p>Fiverr is the better choice when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You offer <strong>productized services</strong> &mdash; logo design, voice over, video editing, social media templates</li>
        <li>You want <strong>passive income</strong> from a gig storefront that works while you sleep</li>
        <li>You're <strong>starting out</strong> and need your first reviews and portfolio pieces</li>
        <li>Your services are typically <strong>under $200</strong> and easy to package into tiers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Third Option &mdash; Why Not Both?</h2>
      <p>Many successful freelancers don't choose one platform &mdash; they use both, plus alternatives. You might use Fiverr for quick, productized services that generate passive orders while using Upwork for larger, custom projects with higher-paying clients.</p>
      <p>And don't overlook the alternatives: <strong>Contra</strong> charges 0% fees (freelancers keep everything), <strong>Guru</strong> offers 5&ndash;9% fees with a SafePay escrow system, and <strong>Freelancer.com</strong> charges 10% with a massive global user base. Diversifying across platforms protects your income and gives you options.</p>
