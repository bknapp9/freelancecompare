      <h2>Fiverr's Fee Structure at a Glance</h2>
      <p>Fiverr charges sellers a flat <span class="fee-cost">20% commission</span> on every order, including tips. There are no tiers, no volume discounts, and no exceptions. Whether you earn $5 or $5,000 on a single order, Fiverr takes one-fifth of it. Buyers pay an additional 5.5% service fee plus a small order fee on orders under $100.</p>
      <p>That advertised "20% fee" doesn't tell the full story, though. When you factor in the buyer-side fees that affect your pricing power, plus withdrawal costs and currency conversion, Fiverr's effective take rate ranges from <span class="fee-cost">24% to over 35%</span> depending on your order size.</p>

      <h2>Seller Fees &mdash; The 20% Commission</h2>
      <p>Fiverr's seller fee is simple but steep: a flat 20% on all earnings, with no tiers and no exceptions. This applies to every dollar you earn on the platform.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flat 20% on ALL earnings</strong> &mdash; no volume discounts, no tier reductions</li>
        <li><strong>Also applies to tips</strong> &mdash; yes, Fiverr takes 20% of tips too</li>
        <li><strong>Logo Makers:</strong> since March 2025, tiered 20&ndash;50% depending on Logo Maker tool usage</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> You charge $100 &rarr; you receive $80 &rarr; Fiverr keeps <span class="fee-cost">$20</span></li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> You charge $500 &rarr; you receive $400 &rarr; Fiverr keeps <span class="fee-cost">$100</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Buyer Fees &mdash; What Your Clients Pay</h2>
      <p>Buyers don't just pay your gig price. Fiverr adds its own fees on top, and these matter because they affect what clients are willing to pay you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5.5% service fee</strong> on all orders</li>
        <li><strong>Small order fee:</strong> $3 on orders under $100</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Client orders a $50 gig &rarr; pays <span class="fee-cost">$55.75</span> ($50 + $2.75 service fee + $3 small order fee)</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Client orders a $200 gig &rarr; pays <span class="fee-cost">$211</span> ($200 + $11 service fee)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These fees matter more than most sellers realize. A client with a $50 budget doesn't have $50 to spend on your gig &mdash; they have about $44 after Fiverr's buyer fees. This invisible price inflation pushes clients toward lower-priced gigs.</p>

      <h2>Withdrawal Fees</h2>
      <p>Once Fiverr releases your funds, you still need to get the money to your bank account. Here's what each withdrawal method costs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PayPal:</strong> Free from Fiverr (but PayPal charges its own conversion fees, typically 2&ndash;4%)</li>
        <li><strong>Bank Transfer:</strong> $1 per withdrawal</li>
        <li><strong>Fiverr Revenue Card:</strong> $3 per withdrawal</li>
        <li><strong>Currency conversion:</strong> 2&ndash;3% on non-USD withdrawals</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Payment Timeline</h2>
      <p>Fiverr doesn't pay you immediately after you deliver work. There's a mandatory holding period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard sellers:</strong> 14 days after order completion</li>
        <li><strong>Top Rated / Fiverr Pro:</strong> 7 days after order completion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This means your money is locked for 1&ndash;2 weeks after delivering work. If you're relying on freelancing income to cover expenses, this delay matters. And the clock doesn't start until the order is marked complete &mdash; if a client takes days to accept delivery, the hold period extends accordingly.</p>

      <h2>The Real Cost &mdash; What Fiverr Actually Takes</h2>
      <p>Here's what Fiverr's fee structure looks like in practice when you combine seller fees, buyer fees, and the effective take rate:</p>

      </div>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Fiverr's effective take rate is 24&ndash;35%, much higher than the advertised "20%". Small orders get hit hardest because the $3 small order fee has a larger proportional impact.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Tips to Maximize Your Earnings on Fiverr</h2>
      <p>You can't avoid Fiverr's 20% commission, but you can minimize the overall impact on your earnings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price your gigs at $100+</strong> to avoid the small order fee penalty for your buyers</li>
        <li><strong>Create package tiers</strong> that push buyers toward higher-value orders &mdash; a $150 package looks like a better deal when the $50 package has a $3 surcharge</li>
        <li><strong>Deliver quality to reach Top Rated faster</strong> &mdash; 7-day payment hold vs. 14-day makes a real difference for cash flow</li>
        <li><strong>Choose your withdrawal method wisely</strong> &mdash; bank transfer ($1) beats the revenue card ($3)</li>
        <li><strong>Factor in currency conversion</strong> &mdash; if you earn in non-USD, that 2&ndash;3% conversion fee adds up over a year</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Fiverr Compares to Other Platforms</h2>
      <p>Fiverr's 20% flat fee is one of the highest in the freelance marketplace space. Upwork charges a variable rate averaging around 10%. Freelancer.com charges 10% (or 3% for preferred freelancers). Guru offers 5&ndash;9% depending on your membership tier. And zero-fee platforms like Contra let you keep 100% of your earnings.</p>
      <p>That said, Fiverr's gig-based model offers something the others don't: passive income potential. Once your gigs rank well, buyers come to you. On Upwork, you're constantly writing proposals and spending Connects. The right platform depends on your working style, not just the fee percentage.</p>
