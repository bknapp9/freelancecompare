      <h2>Freelancer.com's Fee Structure at a Glance</h2>
      <p>Freelancer.com charges freelancers a <span class="fee-cost">10% commission or $5 minimum</span> per project &mdash; whichever is greater. Unlike Upwork's variable model or Fiverr's flat 20%, Freelancer.com's fee is straightforward: one-tenth of every dollar you earn, with a floor that makes very small projects more expensive in percentage terms.</p>
      <p>But the advertised "10%" doesn't capture the full picture. When you factor in bidding costs, membership fees, and withdrawal charges, the real cost of using Freelancer.com can climb to <span class="fee-cost">12&ndash;18%</span> for active bidders. Understanding all the layers is essential before you set your rates.</p>

      <h2>Freelancer Service Fee &mdash; 10% or $5 Minimum</h2>
      <p>The core fee applies to all fixed-price and hourly projects on the platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard fee:</strong> 10% of the project value, or $5 &mdash; whichever is greater</li>
        <li><strong>Applies to:</strong> fixed-price contracts, hourly contracts, milestones</li>
        <li><strong>The $5 minimum hurts small projects:</strong> a $20 project effectively costs you 25% in fees</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> You win a $100 project &rarr; Freelancer takes <span class="fee-cost">$10</span> &rarr; you receive $90</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> You win a $500 project &rarr; Freelancer takes <span class="fee-cost">$50</span> &rarr; you receive $450</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> You win a $30 project &rarr; Freelancer takes <span class="fee-cost">$5</span> (minimum) &rarr; you receive $25</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> The $5 minimum means any project under $50 costs you more than 10% in fees. A $25 project effectively has a 20% fee. Always factor this in when accepting small or milestone-based work.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Employer / Client Fees</h2>
      <p>Freelancer.com also charges clients on top of freelancer fees, which affects your pricing power:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard employer fee:</strong> 3% or $3 minimum &mdash; whichever is greater</li>
        <li><strong>Combined platform cut:</strong> approximately 13% of every transaction (10% from you + 3% from client)</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> You earn $200 &rarr; client pays $206 &rarr; you receive $180 &rarr; Freelancer keeps $26 total</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clients know about this fee, and it does affect their willingness to pay your stated rate. A client with a $200 budget has slightly less than $200 available for your work once their fee is factored in.</p>

      <h2>The Preferred Freelancer Program</h2>
      <p>Freelancer.com runs an invite-only program for top-performing freelancers that unlocks significantly lower fees:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preferred Freelancer fee:</strong> 3% on employer-invited projects (vs standard 10%)</li>
        <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> invitation-only, based on job success score, reviews, and activity</li>
        <li><strong>Access to higher-value projects:</strong> Preferred Freelancers see a separate pool of vetted, higher-budget jobs</li>
        <li><strong>Faster payments:</strong> priority payment processing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you qualify for the Preferred Freelancer Program, your effective fee drops dramatically. A $1,000 project costs $30 in fees instead of $100 &mdash; a saving of $70. Pursuing this status is one of the highest-ROI moves available on the platform.</p>

      <h2>The Bid System &mdash; Free vs Paid Bids</h2>
      <p>Unlike some platforms, Freelancer.com doesn't charge per bid beyond your monthly allocation &mdash; but your monthly allocation is limited, and additional bids cost money. This is Freelancer's equivalent of Upwork's Connects system.</p>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Membership Plan</th>
              <th>Monthly Cost</th>
              <th>Free Bids/Month</th>
              <th>Extra Bid Cost</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Basic (Free)</td>
              <td>$0</td>
              <td>8 bids</td>
              <td>$0.75/bid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Plus</td>
              <td>$35/mo</td>
              <td>100 bids</td>
              <td>$0.75/bid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Professional</td>
              <td>$65/mo</td>
              <td>300 bids</td>
              <td>$0.75/bid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Premier</td>
              <td>$400/mo</td>
              <td>Unlimited</td>
              <td>Included</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>The Basic plan's 8 free bids per month can run out quickly. If you're bidding 2&ndash;3 times per day, you'll exhaust the free tier in under a week. Extra bids at $0.75 each add up: 30 additional bids per month costs $22.50, on top of any commission you'll owe when you win.</p>

      <h2>Contest Fees</h2>
      <p>Freelancer.com's contest marketplace lets clients post design, writing, or development contests with a cash prize. The fee structure differs from standard projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Winner's fee:</strong> 10% of the contest prize amount</li>
        <li><strong>Entry fee:</strong> most contests are free to enter; some have employer-set entry fees</li>
        <li><strong>No win = no fee:</strong> if your entry doesn't win, you pay nothing</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Win a $300 logo contest &rarr; you receive $270 (Freelancer takes $30)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Contests can be good for building a portfolio but the time-to-win ratio is unpredictable. Multiple freelancers compete for the same prize, so your effective hourly rate is often lower than regular project work.</p>

      <h2>Withdrawal Fees</h2>
      <p>Once your funds clear, here's what it costs to move money to your bank account:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PayPal:</strong> Free from Freelancer.com (PayPal charges its own fees, typically 2&ndash;4% on currency conversion)</li>
        <li><strong>Skrill:</strong> Free from Freelancer.com</li>
        <li><strong>Bank wire transfer:</strong> Approximately $25, varies by country and bank</li>
        <li><strong>Payoneer:</strong> Free (Payoneer's own fees may apply)</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum withdrawal:</strong> $30 for most methods</li>
        <li><strong>Currency conversion:</strong> 2&ndash;4% on non-USD transactions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For freelancers outside the US, currency conversion is often the biggest hidden cost. If you earn $5,000/year and your conversion fee averages 3%, that's $150 vanishing before the money even lands in your account.</p>

      <h2>Payment Timeline</h2>
      <p>Freelancer.com uses a milestone-based payment system for fixed projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Milestone payments:</strong> funds released when you complete the milestone and the client approves</li>
        <li><strong>Disputes:</strong> Freelancer.com holds funds in escrow during disputes, which can take days or weeks to resolve</li>
        <li><strong>Hourly contracts:</strong> billed weekly, paid after a short review period</li>
        <li><strong>Cleared funds available immediately</strong> once released &mdash; no mandatory holding period like Fiverr's 14-day delay</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real Cost by Project Value</h2>
      <p>The $5 minimum fee has a disproportionate impact on small projects. Here's what Freelancer.com actually takes at different price points:</p>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Project Value</th>

              <th>You Keep</th>
              <th>Effective Rate</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>$25</td>
              <td><span class="fee-cost">$5 (min)</span></td>
              <td>$20</td>

            <tr>
              <td>$50</td>

            </tr>

      <h2>Annual Earnings Impact</h2>
      <p>Assuming a standard 10% fee rate (projects above $50), here's what Freelancer.com takes across different annual earning levels:</p>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> At higher earning levels, bid costs become a smaller proportion of total fees. But for freelancers still building their client base and bidding heavily, the real effective rate sits closer to 11&ndash;13% before withdrawal fees.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Tips to Maximize Your Earnings on Freelancer.com</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Never accept projects under $50</strong> if you can help it &mdash; the $5 minimum fee means sub-$50 work costs you more than 10%. Price your minimum at $100+ to keep fees predictable.</li>
        <li><strong>Be strategic with bids on the free tier</strong> &mdash; 8 bids per month is limited. Spend them only on projects where you have a strong competitive edge. Avoid bidding on postings with 20+ existing proposals.</li>
        <li><strong>Work toward Preferred Freelancer status</strong> &mdash; dropping from 10% to 3% on invited projects is a massive fee reduction. Focus on building reviews and maintaining a high job success score.</li>
        <li><strong>Use milestone payments</strong> &mdash; requesting payment in milestones (rather than a lump sum at the end) protects your cash flow and reduces the risk of non-payment disputes.</li>
        <li><strong>Use PayPal or Skrill for withdrawals</strong> &mdash; both are free from Freelancer's side. Avoid wire transfers unless withdrawing large amounts where the $25 fee is proportionally small.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider the Plus plan if you bid actively</strong> &mdash; $35/month for 100 bids is $0.35 per bid vs $0.75 for extra bids. If you're submitting more than 46 proposals per month, Plus pays for itself.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Freelancer.com Compares to Other Platforms</h2>
      <p>At 10%, Freelancer.com's commission sits roughly between Upwork (0&ndash;15%, averaging ~10%) and Fiverr (flat 20%). On paper, they look similar to Upwork, but the fee structures work differently in practice.</p>
      <p>Upwork's fee is applied after you win work. Freelancer.com's bid system means you're spending money to compete for projects, while also paying 10% when you win. For freelancers who win a low percentage of bids, the total cost can exceed Upwork's.</p>
      <p>Fiverr's 20% is higher than Freelancer.com's 10%, but Fiverr's gig-based model means clients come to you &mdash; no bidding costs. If you're a high-volume seller with well-ranked gigs, the economics can favor Fiverr despite the higher percentage. For a detailed breakdown of how Fiverr's fees work, see our <a href="/blog/fiverr-fees-explained">Fiverr seller fee guide</a>.</p>
